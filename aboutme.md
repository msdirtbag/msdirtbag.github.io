My name is Eric Mannon. I am a technical product manager at one of the leading MXDR MSSP's and focus exclusively on Microsoft products and services. 

As Cloud Security Architect & Microsoft Certified Trainer, I specialize in the technical enablement of other infosec pros that are new to fabric and trying to operationalize existing investments, optimize security posture, and extract security outcomes.
