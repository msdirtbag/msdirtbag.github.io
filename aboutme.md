---
My name is Eric Mannon. I am a technical product manager at one of the leading MXDR MSSP's and focus exclusively on Microsoft products and services. 

As Cloud Security Architect & Microsoft Certified Trainer, I specialize in the technical enablement of other information security professionals that are new to Microsoft Security fabric and trying to operationalize existing investments, optimize security posture, and extract security outcomes. 

Stay frosty!
