💡The 1st thing to understand about the Azure Monitor Agent is what it is replacing:

The Microsoft Monitoring Agent (or OMS Agent) was introduced in System Center 2012 R2. Over the years, various Microsoft product teams adopted it, and MMA became the default monitoring agent for many Microsoft platforms.

MMA Known Challenges:

·       MMA defaults to TLS 1.1 on older Windows OS’s and needs registry keys to force TLS 1.2 encryption for communication

·       The Linux agent cannot multi-home to multiple Log Analytics workspaces

·       The legacy LA gateway can aggregate logs from offline endpoints but still sends them over the internet (encrypted)

·       The MMA agent authenticates with a static workspaceid/key combo which makes it very flexible and ultimately not well-secured by 2022 standards

🕰️In June 2021, Microsoft made the Azure Monitor Agent generally available, but it was not supported by many products and that has incrementally improved. There are still some features in Public Preview and Private Preview (Linux CEF Collector) but the functionality and reliability is already better than MMA and should be the go-forward agent for all new initiatives.

👉Key detail: AMA does not auth via workspaceid/key like MMA. It auths via System Managed Identities like every other Azure resource. To use AMA, you have to transform the non-Azure resource into an Azure Resource. You do not have to migrate the resource to Azure (but that does work!), you just have to deploy the free Azure Connected Machine fabric agent.

While the Arc/AMA combo is an infinitely powerful control plane for all of your server fleet regardless of the hypervisor or location, you can start small by deploying Arc/AMA to a small group of servers and determining which uses cases make sense for your organization.
