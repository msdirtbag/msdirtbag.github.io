📝Guidelines:

1-Set realistic expectations, objectives, and don’t “force it” on any team.

2-Proactively allocate time for your cybersecurity & infrastructure teams to collaboratively test and POC Azure Arc, Azure Automation, Update Management Center, VM Insights, Windows Admin Center, SSH access, Defender for DevOps, and PowerShell/Chef Machine Configurations.

3-Participate in a “Securing Multicloud Environments” workshop and learn everything you can from an MDC deployment engineer that works these projects all day, every day. (Record and save in Teams)

4-Identify and assign (2+) json-smart security engineers to the Infrastructure as Code team. Get them VS Code & Github Copilot. Give them 4-8 weeks to learn Bicep and then point them towards the “stuff we need you guys to build” list.

5-Use Governance Rules to notify relevant system owners of MDC Security Recommendations. The security team does not manage the servers. The system owners need access to a shared console where they track the same action items.

6-Create WAC/SSHadmin Privileged Access Groups and incrementally disable all other forms of remote management. *Engineers won’t use the new method until the old method stops working. 😉

7-Establish Azure as the common control plane where the cybersecurity and infrastructure team manages “stuff” together.
