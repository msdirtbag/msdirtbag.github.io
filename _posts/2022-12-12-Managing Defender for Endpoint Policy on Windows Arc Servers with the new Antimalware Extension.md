---
ðŸ”»Many clients struggle with Defender for Endpoint policy on Servers because previously, they had an integrated management channel included in their EDR/NGAV solution that was automatic and there was no pro/con debate on different workload types.

ðŸ¤™This is common and understandable. Microsoft hears this on every MDE/MDC feedback call and has released MDE attach (hybrid policy sync with AD Connect) and now the IaaSAntimalware Extension for Arc Servers based on that feedback.

ðŸ“£The Microsoft Antimalware VM Extension is deployed via Automanage to Arc & Azure Servers. While it does not manage Attack Surface Reduction rules today, it does have the ability to manage WDAV exceptions and Real-Time Protection.

ðŸ’¡Strategically, this extension completely decouples Defender for Endpoint policy management from Active Directory without requiring the additional cost associated with Arc Machine Configurations or Azure Automation Runbooks.

ðŸ‘‰My recommendation = Go test and share your feedback on Linkedin!
