“We use another system to manage Windows Updates”

👉That’s cool but let’s do some QA in Update Management Center for no additional cost.

Update management center is a unified service to help manage and govern updates for all your machines. You can monitor Windows and Linux update compliance across your deployments in Azure, on-premises, and on the other cloud platforms from a single dashboard. Using Update management center, you can make updates in real-time or schedule them within a defined maintenance window.

You can use the update management center in Azure to:

🔻Oversee update compliance for your entire fleet of machines in Azure, on- premises, and other cloud environments.

🔻Instantly deploy critical updates to help secure your machines for zero days with (1) command.

🔻Leverage flexible patching options such as automatic VM guest patching of critical & security updates on customer-defined maintenance schedules.

🔻Hotpatching allows you to install updates on supported Windows Server Azure Edition virtual machines without requiring a reboot after installation. It reduces the number of reboots required on your mission critical application workloads running on Windows Server.

Update Management Center is a great way to manage WDAV Security Intelligence Updates today and get a 2nd view on your Servers patching health. UMC is also a powerful security platform for pushing critical & security updates to exposed server assets if that is needed.
