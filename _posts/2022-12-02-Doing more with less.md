👉Doing more with less:

Over the last 3 years, corporate IT operations has been disrupted by Covid, remote-work and increased threat actor activity. With the current economic downturn, improvement projects are being cancelled and postponed again. For the Threat Actor? This is a best-case scenario and prime hunting season.

📖You remember the Battle of the Atlantic? In the 2nd half of 1940, the Allies were losing 1/3 of the supply ships bound for Britain. The defensive counter measures available at the time were no match for the German U-boat technology.

What did they do?
1.     They redid their ship groupings to minimize impact
2.     They used every signal they could collect to inform early detection
3.     They used deception and counterintelligence
4.     They tested, iterated, and developed new defensive tools on the fly
5.     They intercepted enemy communications
6.     They leveraged the tools they had (airpower & corvettes) for maximum impact
7.     They battled, grinded, and eventually won

How can we apply this to cyberdefense in 2022/2023❓

·       Assume all cybersecurity projects that include buying something are cancelled until summer of next year. Take a full inventory of all of the security tools and platforms that your org has today.
·       Identify which ATT&CK data sources the current tools can provide.
·       Identify unused/legacy storage that can be used for stopgap solutions
·       Assign each platform to a Security Engineer and have them complete a deep dive investigation on how that deployment can be improved.
·       Practice and train weekly on early detection, triage, and containment.
·       Red team your own infrastructure and search for choke points that can be leveraged.
·       Invest cycles in hardening OS baselines and increasing attacker cost
·       Deploy deception honeytokens/honey accounts in key systems/data repositories
·       Test that BCP plan often and under the assumption that all systems are encrypted
