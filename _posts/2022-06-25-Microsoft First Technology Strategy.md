·       Does your organization use M365❓
·       Does your organization have any Azure resources today❓
·       Does your organization use Windows as the primary Server/Workstation OS❓

If you answered yes to all of the above questions, your organization is a logical candidate for a “Microsoft 1st Strategy”.

💡What is a Microsoft 1st Strategy?

🔻What it is not:

·       It is not a rubber stamp to use all things Microsoft with no due diligence, auditing, or purple teaming.

·       It is not what every best of breed vendor puts in their marketing propaganda

👉What it is:

💰It’s a mature understanding of total cost-of-ownership. When every best of breed vendor pitches you on their product, they focus on everything their product can do but most best of breed security teams end up needing to establish 5-20 contracts with best of breed vendors for products that don’t talk to each other and have a massive iceberg of administration costs that balloons TCO to unexpected levels and angers with C-suite. Often, the security team doesn’t have cycles to fight the battle, so the best of breed vendor becomes shelfware and ROI is never realized. (But the CISO had it in his board update!)

✅It’s a strategy that says “Let’s prioritize using Microsoft solutions that meet business and infosec requirements because we know they talk to each other and will be constantly improved because Microsoft is pouring R&D investments into them.”

✅It’s an understanding that 3rd party vendors & open source solutions will always be needed but they need to be fabric compatible and carefully selected. Pick the ones that provide the most value to the business and infosec team. While Palo Alto, Fortinet, ZScaler, and Cisco will always pitch you on their competitive solutions, their core solutions are very compatible with a Microsoft 1st strategy and their bolt-on solutions are logical alternatives if the Microsoft solution does not meet your specific requirements.

🙂There are no right or wrong answers. Use whatever works! Just don’t let cybersecurity vendor propaganda influence your decisions.

It’s your fabric. You get to buy the groceries, cook the dinner, and get feedback on how it tastes!
