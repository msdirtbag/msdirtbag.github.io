👉Does your MDE deployment include Windows Exploit Protection?

Exploit Protection, Attack Surface Reduction Rules & Windows Defender Application Control are baked into Windows Kernel for every org to use but most do not because they have a 3rd party EPP agent that "should handle everything”.

🔻For MDE clients, the (3) solutions above are key because they generate additional free telemetry in the DeviceEvents table that can fuel 365D Custom Detections & Sentinel Scheduled/NRT Analytic rules.

😉Tips:
·       For all things Exploit Guard (ASR/EP/WDAC) on brownfield endpoints, Audit is the most important concept. Audit 1st then identify where blocks are logical.
·       The more you can block, the more painful and noisy the typical Discovery, Privilege Escalation, & Lateral Movement TA playbook will become.
·       Start with Audit on everything and hunt possible Block wins collaboratively with your system owners in KQL.

📝Note:
Many of the features in the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) are included in exploit protection. You can convert and import existing your EMET configuration profiles into exploit protection.

💡Many SCCM admins will recognize Exploit Guard & Exploit Protection from past experiences so if you are on the infosec team and craving high impact EDR telemetry, find them!
