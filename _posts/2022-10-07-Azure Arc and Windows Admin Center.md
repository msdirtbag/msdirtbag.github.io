Windows Admin Center is a free solution for managing Windows Servers and includes several powerful tools that the security team might want to leverage!

With the Windows Admin Center extension in Azure, you get the management, configuration, troubleshooting, and maintenance functionality for managing your Arc-enabled servers in the Azure portal. You can securely manage hybrid machines from anywhereâ€“without needing a VPN, public IP address, or other inbound TCP ports forwarded to endpoints.

Using Windows Admin Center in the Azure portal, you can manage:

âœ…Certificates
âœ…Devices
âœ…Events
âœ…Files and file sharing
âœ…Firewall
âœ…Installed apps
âœ…Local users and groups
âœ…Performance Monitor
ðŸ’°Full PowerShell
ðŸ”¥Processes Dumps
ðŸ”¥Packet Captures
âœ…Registry
âœ…Remote Desktop
âœ…Roles and Features
âœ…Scheduled tasks
âœ…Services
âœ…Storage
âœ…Updates
âœ…Hyper V Virtual machines
âœ…Virtual switches

Notes:

*Starting August 2022, Windows Admin Center now allows you to use Azure AD-based authentication for your hybrid machine. You will no longer be prompted for the credentials of a local administrator account.

*Enabling this capability will replace your existing instance of Windows Admin Center and removes the capability to manage other machines. Your previously deployed instance of Windows Admin Center will no longer be usable. Please donâ€™t do this if you use your instance of Admin Center to manage multiple servers.
